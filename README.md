# Vintage Software CSharp (C#) Style Guide

Code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contributed.

> “Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute.”
> — H. Abelson and G. Sussman (in “Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs”)

For C# code styles use [Style Cop Plus](https://stylecopplus.codeplex.com/) and [Visual Studio Code Analysis](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3z0aeatx.aspx). Download the config files [here](https://github.com/vintage-software/csharp/tree/master/linters).
